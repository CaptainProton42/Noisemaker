# Noisemaker

*Tiny* tool for creating noise textures written in Godot. I use it sometimes to quickly create noise textures and I thought it might come in handy for others as well.

Supports Worley Noise through a custom GPU-based implementation and OpenSimplex-Noise though [Godot's built-in](https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/classes/class_opensimplexnoise.html) generator.
